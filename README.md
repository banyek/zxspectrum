# zxspectrum
A few small basic programs for ZX Spectrum

THIS README NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN, NOW THIS IS JUST A REMINDER

The programs are created / loaded from tzx files. 
The code is extracted from the tzx files with tzxtools
eg.
    tzxcat tzx/PROGRAM01.tzx -B > program1.bas
    tzxcat tzx/PROGRAM02.tzx -B > program2.bas
